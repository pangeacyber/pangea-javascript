# Contributing

Currently, the setup scripts only have support for Mac/ZSH environments.
Future support is incoming.

To install our linters, simply run `./dev/setup_repo.sh`
These linters will run on every `git commit` operation.

## Generating Node SDK Docs

We use TypeDoc to pull doc strings from all the files in our SDK.

To generate the docs.json, from the root of the pangea-node-sdk repo run:

```
# install node modules if you haven't already
yarn

# generate the docs JSON file
yarn generate:docs
```

This generates a JSON file (docs.json) which contains all our doc strings.
