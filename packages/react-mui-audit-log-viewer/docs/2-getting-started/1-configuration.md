To learn more about Material-UI (MUI) check out their [official documentation](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/).

## Customization

Our components use the Material-UI component library, so styling of the component can be controlled through a MUI Theme. See Theming documentation [here](https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/theming/).

What to apply your Pangea branding to your end application? Check out the `@pangeacyber/react-mui-branding` NPM package [here](https://github.com/pangeacyber/pangea-javascript/tree/main/packages/react-mui-branding). The `BrandingThemeProvider` can fetch your Pangea Projects Branding and apply the styling to a Material-UI Theme.
